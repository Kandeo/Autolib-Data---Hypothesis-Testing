# Hypothesis Testing

#### Data Science Project, November 2021

#### By **Christine Kiki**

## Description
Autolib electric car-sharing service company has tasked us to understand Electric car usage by investigating a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.

Working on the project, we shall perform the following analysis with Python;

- Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
- Plotting appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.
